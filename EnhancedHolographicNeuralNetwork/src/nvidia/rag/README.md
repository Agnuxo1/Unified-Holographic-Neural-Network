# NVIDIA RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

NVIDIA's RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances large language models by combining them with external knowledge retrieval. This approach allows the model to access and utilize information beyond its training data, improving the accuracy and relevance of its responses.

## How it works

1. Query Processing: The input query is processed and used to retrieve relevant information from an external knowledge base.
2. Knowledge Retrieval: A retrieval system searches the knowledge base for documents or passages that are most relevant to the query.
3. Context Augmentation: The retrieved information is combined with the original query to create an augmented prompt.
4. Generation: The augmented prompt is fed into a large language model, which generates a response based on both the query and the retrieved information.

This process allows the model to provide more informed and accurate responses by leveraging external knowledge.

## Key Features

- Improved accuracy and relevance of responses
- Ability to access and utilize up-to-date information
- Reduced hallucination and factual errors
- Customizable knowledge bases for domain-specific applications
