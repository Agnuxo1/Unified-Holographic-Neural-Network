# Enhanced Unified Holographic Neural Network

## Project Overview

The Enhanced Unified Holographic Neural Network is an advanced AI system that combines holographic memory, neural networks, and optical computing principles. This project, developed by Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, aims to create a more efficient and powerful AI model capable of learning, storing, and retrieving information in a manner inspired by the human brain and holographic principles.

## Key Features

- Holographic memory for efficient information storage and retrieval
- Neural network architecture for learning and pattern recognition
- Optical computing simulation for enhanced processing capabilities
- P2P network integration for distributed learning and knowledge sharing
- Real-time learning and prediction capabilities
- Integration with external LLM models for enhanced text generation
- File processing capabilities (TXT and PDF) for knowledge ingestion
- Interactive 3D visualization of the neural network

## Ray Tracing and CUDA Acceleration

The EUHNN utilizes NVIDIA's Ray Tracing and CUDA technologies to simulate the optical neural network efficiently. Key aspects of the implementation include:

Ray Tracing: A Monte Carlo path tracing algorithm simulates the propagation of light through the holographic memory and neural network elements. The optical elements are modeled as a combination of refractive and diffractive surfaces. Lenses are simulated using thin lens approximations, while diffraction gratings are modeled using phase functions that alter the direction of incident rays based on their wavelength.

CUDA: CUDA kernels are implemented to accelerate complex optical operations such as convolutions and Fourier transforms. This allows for highly parallel computations on the GPU, significantly improving performance. Custom CUDA kernels are also used to simulate wave propagation effects and interference patterns critical for holographic computations.

RTX Hardware: The project takes advantage of RTX hardware features like RT Cores for accelerated ray-triangle intersection tests, Tensor Cores for matrix operations in neural network layers, and specialized hardware for denoising the Monte Carlo rendered results. This combination of features allows for real-time simulation of complex optical phenomena within the neural network architecture.
The integration of these technologies enables the EUHNN to perform optical neural computations at speeds comparable to traditional electronic neural networks while maintaining the advantages of optical processing, such as reduced power consumption and increased parallelism.
