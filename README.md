# Enhanced Unified Holographic Neural Network

## Project Overview

The Enhanced Unified Holographic Neural Network is an advanced AI system that combines holographic memory, neural networks, and optical computing principles. This project, developed by Francisco Angulo de Lafuente, aims to create a more efficient and powerful AI model capable of learning, storing, and retrieving information in a manner inspired by the human brain and holographic principles.

## Key Features

- Holographic memory for efficient information storage and retrieval
- Neural network architecture for learning and pattern recognition
- Optical computing simulation for enhanced processing capabilities
- P2P network integration for distributed learning and knowledge sharing
- Real-time learning and prediction capabilities
- Integration with external LLM models for enhanced text generation
- File processing capabilities (TXT and PDF) for knowledge ingestion
- Interactive 3D visualization of the neural network

## Technology Stack

- React for the frontend user interface
- Three.js and React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations
- Node.js for backend processing
- WebRTC (via PeerJS) for P2P networking
- PDF.js for PDF file processing
- LocalForage for client-side storage

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/username/enhanced-holographic-neural-network.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd enhanced-holographic-neural-network
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Usage

1. **Chat Interface**: Use the chat interface to interact with the AI. Type your messages and receive responses generated by the holographic neural network.

2. **Learning**: Use the learning interface to teach the AI new associations between inputs and outputs.

3. **File Processing**: Upload TXT or PDF files to ingest new knowledge into the system.

4. **Knowledge Management**: Save and load the AI's knowledge base using the provided buttons.

5. **Training**: Use the training button to run the AI through a series of random inputs and outputs to enhance its knowledge.

6. **P2P Networking**: Connect with other instances of the application to share and distribute knowledge across the network.

7. **3D Visualization**: Observe the real-time 3D representation of the neural network, including neurons, connections, and context nodes.
